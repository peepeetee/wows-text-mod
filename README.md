# wows-text-mod
Text mod for World of Warships

This is a text mod for World of Warships that replaces all ship names with their native script:

Russian --> Cyrillic

Chinese, Japanese, Korean --> Chinese Characters


## Usage

wows_version is set to be the latest world of warship version on windows.

if the game preloads the next version, change wows_version to the current version string.

After a breaking change in the game in 2025, Game language has to be set to Japanese for this to render correctly. Chinese or Korean might also work. Use the web version of armory to have it be in your browser's language.
